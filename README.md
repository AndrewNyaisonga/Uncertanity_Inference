# Uncertanity_Inference


Before I begin, for full disclosure most of the classes and the Bayesian Network implementation is adapted from Professor George Ferguson. There is however things that I opted to change on his packages setup. All the Inference methods have been implemented entry by me. Okay, now that we put that out of the way let’s get in the code itself. In the Src then bn folder there are 5 packages core,example, inference,parser and util. Let’s talk about one by and one and what they contain.
